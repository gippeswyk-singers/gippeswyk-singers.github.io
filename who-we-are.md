### Our History

In 1972, the Gippeswyk Singers chamber choir was formed by Geoff Lavery who was teaching at Ipswich School.

Barry Salmon took up the baton in 1986 and conducted the choir until 2010, arranging a great deal of music especially for them - a tenure of nearly 25 years.

Alan Loader conducted the choir in 2010 for just over a year.

Geoff Lavery returned to Suffolk in 2012 upon his retirement and once again conducted the choir until 2021, including holding the choir together through the very challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Janette Ruocco took up the post in September 2021 and continues to successfully lead the choir.
