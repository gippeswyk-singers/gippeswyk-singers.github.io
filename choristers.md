#### Subscriptions {#subscriptions}

Can be paid via bank transfer or by cheque. Contact the treasurer (Michael Dawe) for further details.

#### Email Group {#email-group}

The choir uses a Google Group email address so that we can easily send information to all choir members. Graeme Ludwig looks after the administration of the Google Group.

On joining the choir, please give your email address to Kaye Dawe. If you have a Gmail email address (i.e. one ending <em>@gmail.com</em>) then please give us that email address to use if you can, as it makes our lives a bit easier.

Graeme will then add your email address to the group. If possible he will add your email address directly to the group, and you should then start to receive emails sent to all choir members. Otherwise you will be sent an invitation to join the group. The email will be sent from <em>noreply@groups.google.com</em>. An example of the email invitation is below:

{% include figure.html image="../assets/googleGroupExampleInvite.png" caption="Example of a Google Group Invitation" alt="Example of a Google Group Invitation" width="825" height="852" %}

If you cannot find the above email after Graeme has sent you an invite you may need to check your spam folder, and/or search for the email directly; I'd suggest searching on the email address <em>noreply@groups.google.com</em>. If you still cannot find the email please speak to Graeme, and he'll do what he can to help you out.

Once you find the email click on the <em>Accept this invitation</em> button. Your Internet browser (Chrome, Safari etc.) should then open up and display this page:

{% include figure.html image="../assets/successfullyJoinedGoogleGroup.png" caption="Successfully Joined Google Group" alt="Successfully Joined Google Group" width="1032" height="405" %}

You should then start to receive emails sent to all choir members. If you have any questions on the above please speak to Graeme.

#### FOGIES {#fogies}

Do you know anyone who would like to be in "Fogies" (Friends of Ipswich Singers)? For an annual fee of £30 (£50 for a couple), they will receive:
- a ticket for each concert
- a complimentary glass of wine at the Chairman’s table
- email alerts to up coming events

#### Rehearsal Space {#rehearsal-space}

The piano has now been fitted with new castors and can be readily moved providing greater flexibility and will be positioned by the emergency exit doors. This provides the maximum ventilation for the conductor being the most vulnerable, facing the whole choir. This allows us to enter the hall via the usual entrance.

The layout of the chairs maximises the space between singers. At the first rehearsal the seating will be labelled to indicate the voices.

For the break during the rehearsal, please bring your own refreshments as the use of the kitchen facilities is restricted.

Please note that whilst the committee has made every effort to provide a safe environment for those returning to singing, it is the individual’s choice and responsibility as to whether they attend. See our [COVID policy](../covid-policy "COVID policy") for more details.

#### Concert Dress {#concert-dress}

* Men - black trousers and black shirt
* Ladies - Red top and black trousers or long black skirt
* No jewellery please!
