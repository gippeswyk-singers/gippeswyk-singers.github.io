#### FOGIES

Do you know anyone who would like to be in "Fogies" (Friends of Ipswich Singers)? For an annual fee of £30 (£50 for a couple), they will receive:
- a ticket for each concert
- a complimentary glass of wine at the Chairman’s table
- email alerts to up coming events

#### Rehearsal Space
The piano has now been fitted with new castors and can be readily moved providing greater flexibility and will be positioned by the emergency exit doors. This provides the maximum ventilation for the conductor being the most vulnerable, facing the whole choir. This allows us to enter the hall via the usual entrance.

The layout of the chairs maximises the space between singers. At the first rehearsal the seating will be labelled to indicate the voices.

For the break during the rehearsal, please bring your own refreshments as the use of the kitchen facilities is restricted.

Please note that whilst the committee has made every effort to provide a safe environment for those returning to singing, it is the individual’s choice and responsibility as to whether they attend. See our [COVID policy](../covid-policy "COVID policy") for more details.

#### Concert Dress

* Men - black trousers and black shirt
* Ladies - Red top and black trousers or long black skirt
* No jewellery please!
